## Devlog
Kaleb Reyes, he/him

The plan my table made and my code have the Player be able to move use WASD and spawning seeds using space. The number of seeds in my code is tracked using three different variables rather than the one that my plan mentioned. The UI in my code doesn't have a variable to track the amount of seeds left and planted. Rather, it uses the variables in the Player script. Like mentioned in the plan, the UI gets updated everytime the user presses the space bar.
